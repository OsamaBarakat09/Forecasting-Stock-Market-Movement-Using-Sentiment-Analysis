       "[\"Water bills in England and Wales were always going to rise massively. The question was the degree.Ofwat has landed on figuresthat, for about three-quarters of the companies, represent roughly what they wanted in order to fund regular operations and build new projects.The response in the share prices of the few firms that remain on the stock market always offers the best instant guide to these hellishly complicated five-yearly regulatory determinations. On a bad day in the wider market, Severn Trent andUnited Utilitieswere two of best performers in the FTSE 100 index; Pennon, owner of South West Water, was in step in the FTSE 250.That reaction is understandable when you look at how far the economic regulator has shifted betweenJuly’s draft versionand Thursday’s final one. The total expenditure allowances for the sector – to be funded from bills – has climbed from £88bn to £104bn over the next five years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The rest relates to matters of judgment on, for example, companies’ cost of capital, where Ofwat said it is “conforming to market expectations” by nudging upwards. That is a “positive” outcome for the listed trio, analysts at Barclays and Jefferies agree.The government will be delighted, one suspects. For the bulk of water companies, including most of the unquoted ones, there is no question mark over their “investability”, the word industry lobbyists deploy to try to terrify ministers and regulators. Bondholders and shareholders will not be running for hills at the likes of UnitedUtilities, which asked for a 36% rise in bills and got 32%, or even Yorkshire, which wanted 46% and got 41%. The size of those adjustments is normal in these price exercises.But then one comes to the dogs of the sector, Southern and Thames Water. The former,now torturing tens of thousands of its customers in Hampshire with outages, wanted a preposterous pre-inflation 83% rise in bills over five years and got 53%. Thames, simultaneouslycopping an £18m finefor outrageously ignoring rules of dividend payments, pitched for 53% and got 35%.In both cases, the eventual bill rise may be slightly more – but only because Ofwat has so little faith in the companies’ ability to build certain projects that it hasn’t granted the accompanying funding upfront.In both cases, the eventual bill rise may be slightly more – but, revealingly, only because Ofwat has so little faith in the companies’ ability to actually build certain projects that it hasn’t granted the accompanying funding upfront.Thames and Southern, like everybody else, are free to run off to the Competition and Markets Authority to dispute Ofwat’s calculations. But both debt-ridden outliers would be well advised to think twice. On a sector-wide view, the embattled Ofwat has set bills at a level that will allow the average company to ramp up spending on, for example, storm overflows. If Southern and Thames can’t live with average expectations, their investors will just have to take more pain.In Thames’s case, its current shareholders have already been wiped out, so we’re talking about the size of haircuts for the bondholders. The small “B” class is trading at pennies in the pound. The “A” class, representing about £15bn of debt, is at about 70p in the pound. Crunch the numbers and that implies a write-down of about £5bn. If that is still not enough to attract £3bn-plus of new equity capital, the bondholders will just have to take a bigger thump. If Thames were still a listed company, the market would have forced a financial restructuring years ago.None of Thursday’s number-crunching will satisfy the lobby that would prefer to re-nationalise the entire sector. But the government has zero appetite for such an adventure, and is even frightened of tipping Thames into special administration, AKA temporary public ownership. So the current setup is the one we’re stuck with, at least untilSir John Cunliffe’s new Water Commissionadvises differently.But this is probably the last chance for the sector to regain a semblance of trust with the public after the years of pollution scandals and dividend-gouging.Ofwat, doing the politically expedient thing, has pushed the limit of public tolerance for bill increases. Now the investors behind Southern and Thames should stop bleating and accept the reality of haircuts and exceptional capital injections. Just get on with it.\"]"

There’s no question about it,” Trudeau said Friday. “Our responsibility is to point out that in this way he would be actually not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States; he’d actually be raising prices for American citizens as well and hurting American industry and businesses.”CNN’s Kit Maher contributed reporting to this post.']\n"

Meanwhile, law enforcement agencies probed threats made against several ofhis Cabinet nomineesand at leastsix Democratic lawmakersduring the holiday week.', 'The border wall separating Mexico and the United States is seen in Imperial County, California in 2022.Allison Dinner/AFP/Getty ImagesThe California State Legislature is hosting a special session this week that lawmakers say will help safeguard the state against President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House.The incoming Trump administration’splans to implement strict border measures,strike down Biden-era policies, and kick off the detention and deportation of migrants at large scale are underway — and one of the biggest concerns for Democrats in the Golden State.While other states are willing to assist in enforcing federal immigration law, Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla said California leaders believe they are under no obligation to do so.“We’re not going to utilize state and local resources to do the federal government’s job for them,” Padilla said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday.Indiscriminate deportation of undocumented immigrants would tear communities apart and cause tremendousdamage to the economy, Padilla said. And using state or local law enforcement for immigration duties could harm public safety, the senator said, because immigrants who are witnesses to crimes may be afraid to come forward.However, Padilla said Democrats and Republicans would agree to a focus on deporting violent criminal, which some Trump allies haveemphasized as the first stepin his plan.“It doesn’t have to be a conflict unless that’s what Trump wants,” Padilla said.', 'Massad Boulos sits for a portrait in New York on September 4.Jeenah Moon for The Washington Post via Getty ImagesPresident-elect Donald Trump has selected billionaire Massad Boulos to serve as senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs, he announced Sunday.Boulos is the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter, Tiffany, and was heavily involved in the president-elect’s campaign outreach to Muslim communities in battleground states. Trump did not mention his familial connection to Boulos in Sunday’s announcement.“Massad is an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected leader in the business world, with extensive experience on the International scene,” Trump wrote in apost on Truth Social.“He is a dealmaker, and an unwavering supporter of PEACE in the Middle East. He will be a strong advocate for the United States, and its interests, and I am pleased to have him on our team!” wrote Trump, who also touted the billionaire’s conservative credentials.On Saturday, Trump named real estate executiveCharles Kushnerto serve as the next US ambassador to France. He is the father of Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law.', 'Kash Patel speaks during a campaign rally for Donald Trump in Las Vegas on October 24.Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty ImagesDemocratic lawmakers are expressing their concern Sunday over President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to head the FBI, firebrand Trump loyalist Kash Patel.Patel has heavily criticized the FBI in the past and called for “a comprehensive housecleaning” of the Justice Department, arguing it has unjustly targeted Republicans and their allies.He would be replacing current FBI Director Christopher Wray, whom Trump appointed and still has three years left of his term — making it an extraordinary move if the president-elect follows through.Here’s what Democrats have said this morning:•Democratic Sen. Chris Murphysaid he would vote against confirming Patel — and rally his fellow senators and the American public to oppose his nomination. “Kash Patel’s only qualification is because he agrees with Donald Trump that the Department of Justice should serve to punish, lock up and intimidate Donald Trump’s political opponents. And so the cost to the American public is pretty simple,” Murphy said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”• Majority Whip Dick Durbindescribed Patel as an “unqualified loyalist” in a statement Sunday. Durbin called on the Senate to “reject this unprecedented effort to weaponize the FBI for the campaign of retribution that Donald Trump has promised.”• Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said Patel’s pledge to go after the so-called deep state refers to simply punishing “anybody who doesn’t do the will of Donald Trump.” Raskin told CNN’s Kasie Hunt on “State of the Union” that claims Wray, “a Republican appointed by a Republican,” went after Trump and his allies for political gain are unfounded.• Democratic Sen. Alex Padillasaid the plan to nominate Patel raises questions about the politicization of the FBI and Justice Department. “Is it a genuine, legitimate appointment — or a political appointment to politicize the Bureau and the Department in Trump’s favor?” Padilla, who serves on the Judiciary Committee, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”', 'Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said Sunday that President-elect Donald Trump will quickly deliver on his promise to impose steeptariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada and China.Trump’s threat of increased taxes on imported goods has already given the country more leverage over trade partners, Cruz said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday.Cruz claimed Mexico will cooperate with Trump on immigration issues in response to the threat of tariffs, and criticized President Joe Biden’s immigration policies, questioning why the president had not used Trump’s tariff tactic.“This is a promise that I believe President Trump is going to deliver on — and deliver quickly,” Cruz said. “We are going to secure the border. This is about using leverage to get Mexico and Canada to cooperate.”Some context:Cruz’s claim about Mexico cooperating with Trump’s border plans comes after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and the US president-elect offereddiffering descriptions of a call about that topiclast week. Sheinbaum denied proposing that Mexico would close its border with the United States, as Trump had claimed in a post on Truth Social.While Cruz accused the Biden administration of inaction on immigration, he was serving in the Senate when Trump lobbied Republican lawmakers tooppose a bipartisan border deal— in part because he wanted to campaign on the issue in the 2024 presidential election, as CNN has previously reported.', 'White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan praised the professionalism of his counterparts in President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration on Sunday.“We’ve had good communication with the incoming Trump team. I’ve engaged with my successor, as a current sitting member of Congress, Mike Waltz, and we’ve been transparent, and we’ve been coordinated, and I’m glad to see they came out to support the Lebanon ceasefire,” Sullivan said, referring to thedeal struck last weekto pause the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.The national security adviser echoed those remarks in an interview with ABC’s Jonathan Karl that also aired this morning.“We got a lot of work to do,” Sullivan said on ABC. “And I have to say that I’ve been gratified so far by the coordination I’ve been able to have with the incoming Trump team. They seem focused also on a smooth transition, because they want to be able to hit the ground running,” he added.Sullivan also spoke positively of the incoming Trump national security team in Sunday interviews with NBC and CBS.', 'Kash Patel speaks during a campaign event for Republican election candidates in July 2022 in Tucson, Arizona.Brandon Bell/Getty Images/FilePresident-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that he intends tonominate Kash Patelto serve as FBI director, indicating that he will make the extraordinary move of replacing the current director, Christopher Wray, before his 10-year term expires.As a reminder, Trump also nominated Wray.Patel has heavily criticized the FBI and vowed to dismantle the “deep state,” which he says includes “elected leaders, journalists, Big Tech tycoons and ‘members of the unelected bureaucracy.’” Patel has also called for “a comprehensive housecleaning” of the Justice Department, arguing it has unjustly targeted Republicans and their allies.Here’s how some Republicans are responding to Trump’s announcement:• GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley,the incoming Senate Judiciary chair, heavily criticized Wray, saying in asocial media postthat the current FBI director “failed” during his tenure. Grassley added that Patel “must prove to Congress” that he will do better than Wray.• House Speaker Mike Johnsonpraised the Patel pick in apost on X, saying he has “extensive experience in national security and intelligence. He is an America First patriot who will bring much-needed change and transparency to the FBI. Congratulations to Kash!”• Republican Rep. Mike Lawlersaid he had no reservations about Patel serving as head of the FBI due to his previous roles in public service. “Donald Trump campaigned on reforming the FBI and the Department of Justice. So I don’t know why any of this is frankly surprising to people,” Lawler told Kasie Hunt on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Lawler added that he does not foresee Patel going on a “revenge tour” or partisanship being part of his leadership.• GOP Sen. Mike Roundssaid on ABC’s “This Week” that he wasn’t surprised by Trump’s pick and that he currently has no complaints on how the president-elect has selected his Cabinet and other key positions. Rounds said there will be open hearings for the public to weigh in on Trump’s picks, and that they deserve the benefit of the doubt while the Senate goes through the process ofproviding Trump with advice and consent.• Republican Sen. Ted Cruzsaid he believes that regardless of Patel’s nomination, Wray will either resign or be removed by Trump. Cruz said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that he believes Patel is a strong candidate who can “clean out” Washington.• GOP Sen. Bill Hagerty, who remains one of Trump’s staunchest defenders, affirmed his support of the Patel pick. “He represents the type of change that we need to see in the FBI,” Hagerty said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”This post has been updated with additional comments from Republicans.', 'Former national security adviser John Bolton speaks to reporters in Washington, DC in August 2022.Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesFormer national security adviser John Bolton says the Senate should reject Kash Patel as FBI director if he isnominated as promisedby President-elect Donald Trump.“Trump has nominated Kash Patel to be his Lavrenty Beria. Fortunately, the FBI is not the NKVD,” Bolton told CNN, referencing Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin’s chief of the secret police. “The Senate should reject this nomination 100-0.”Bolton was one of several national security advisers who served and then eventually resigned or were fired during Trump’s first term in the White House. He has since become avocal Trump critic.Trump’s announcement on Patel, a loyalist to the president-elect and fierce critic of the FBI, has set up another potentially explosive confirmation battle in the Senate, where members arealready bracingfor how they’ll navigate a slew of unorthodox Trump picks.', 'National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan answers questions during a briefing at the White House in November 2023.Win McNamee/Getty ImagesJake Sullivan, President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, declined to comment Sunday on President-elect Donald Trump’s intention toname loyalist Kash Patel as FBI directoronce he takes office, but said it was vital to keep the position insulated from politics.Sullivan said the Biden administration had upheld that “long-standing bipartisan tradition,” telling CNN’s Kasie Hunt on “State of the Union” that Christopher Wray — the current FBI director, whom Trump would replace before the end of his term — has performed well in the role.“We inherited Director Chris Wray, who has done a very good job in the role, from President-elect Trump, who appointed him to a 10-year term. And what makes the FBI director different from most other nominees is they’re not just appointed for one term of a president, they’re appointed for enough time to last past two terms of a president, because they’re supposed to be insulated from politics,” Sullivan said.As for Trump’s specific picks, Sullivan said, “I’ll let him speak for his own rationale.”Hunt asked Sullivan if he feared personal retribution from Patel, who has criticized the national security adviser as part of the “deep state” in the past, but Sullivan said it wasn’t something he was concerned about.“I wake up every day to try to defend this country and protect the national interest. I’ve got 50 days left. I’m going to stay totally focused on every single one of those days to make sure that we have a smooth handoff to the next team, and we put them in the best strategic position possible,” he said.Some context:Trump’s announcement on Patel, a vocal critic of the FBI, is part of a trend of filling top law enforcement and intelligence positions with supporters who may be open to carrying out his demands for specific investigations, as well as inoculating the president against possible future probes.CNN’s Holmes Lybrand, Zachary Cohen, Evan Perez and Kristen Holmescontributed reporting to this post.', 'Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, announced Sunday that he is entering the race to lead the national party.Wikler is the fourth person to toss his name into the running for the next Democratic National Committee chair — a role that would oversee the party’s rebuilding as it continues to reel fromPresident-elect Donald Trump’s win and Republicansclinching control of both chambersof Congress.“I’m running for chair of the Democratic National Committee because we need to unite. We need to fight, and we need to win to stop the GOP from ripping this country apart and ripping off working people to enrich mega billionaires who funded (President-elect Donald) Trump’s campaign,”Wikler told CNN’s Manu Raju on “Inside Politics Sunday.”“This is a time for Democrats to come together to learn about what we need to do and change, and to start winning elections up and down the ballot for the next four years,” Wikler said.Wikler joins a competitive — and likely growing — field, including New York State Sen. James Skoufis, former Maryland Gov. and Social Security Administrator Martin O’Malley, and Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party Chair Ken Martin.Democrats will vote on February 1 to select the party’s leader, who will also supervise the selection of the 2028 primary calendar, which was reshuffled before 2020 to play to the strengths of President Joe Biden.Since Wikler’s election to lead the Wisconsin Democrats in 2019, the party has been able to boast several key victories for Democrats, including maintaining the governorship andholding onto a key Senate seatdespite Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 defeat in the state. Though Trump flipped Wisconsin earlier this month, he won by 0.8% — the thinnest margin of any swing state.More context:Democratic operatives involved in key races told CNN they don’t know how to figure out what those voters who went for Trump want, or how they’re doing in appealing to them.In CNN’s conversations with two dozen top Democratic operatives and elected officials since Election Day, the fear isn’t just that no one knows the answer to what’s next — it’s that they don’t even know what the question is at this point.Read more about conversations among Democrats about their path forwardhere.CNN’s Antoinette Radford contributed to this report.', 'President-elect Donald Trump attends a  SpaceX Starship rocket launch, in Brownsville, Texas, on November 19.Brandon Bell/Pool/Reuters/FilePresident-elect Donald Trump continues to fill out the ranks of his administration, making another series of picks for top roles before and after the Thanksgiving holiday.In an extraordinary move, he announced Saturday that he intends to replace the current FBI director, Christopher Wray, before the end of his term, installing loyalistKash Patelonce he takes office.Trump’s interest in Patel speaks to his urge to fill top law enforcement and intelligence positions with supporters who may be open to carrying out his demands for specific investigations — as well as inoculating the president against possible future probes.The president-elect also said Saturday that he’s picking the sheriff of Hillsborough County, Florida,Chad Chronister, to serve as his Drug Enforcement Agency administrator, and real estate developerCharles Kushnerto serve as the next US ambassador to France. Kushner is the father of Jared Kushner, the president elect’s son-in-law, and waspardoned by Trumpin 2020 after serving a prison sentence following a conviction on federal charges.Here are some of the other recent picks Trump has announced:Jamieson Greerwas picked to serve as US Trade Representative.Dr. Jay Bhattacharyawas picked to lead the National Institutes of Health.Jim O’Neillwas picked to be the deputy secretary of Health and Human Services.Vince Haleywas picked to be the director of the Domestic Policy Council.Kevin Hassettwas picked to be the director of the White House National Economic Council.John Phelanwas picked to be the secretary of the Navy.Gen. Keith Kelloggas his pick for Assistant to the President and Special Envoy for Ukraine and Russia.', 'Pete Hegseth talks to reporters after a series of meetings with senators in the Russell Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill on November 21.Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesThe mother of Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Defense, sent an email to her son in 2018 that sharply criticized his treatment of women,The New York Times reported Friday.Penelope Hegseth told her son in the email that there are “many” women whom he has “abused in some way” and encouraged him to “get some help,” according to excerpts of the email published by The Times.The email’s partial publication comes as the defense secretary pick, a military veteran and Fox News host with no prior government experience, is expected to face atough Senate confirmation process, including questions about a sexual assault allegation from October 2017. No charges were filed against Hegseth related to theincident, and he has denied the accusation, claiming the sexual encounter was consensual.According to The Times’ report, Penelope Hegseth wrote, “I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego. You are that man (and have been for years) and as your mother, it pains me and embarrasses me to say that, but it is the sad, sad truth.”Penelope Hegseth on Friday told The New York Times that she wrote the email “in anger, with emotion” and that she had immediately apologized in a separate email. She went on to defend her son, saying her own characterization of his treatment of women in the 2018 email “has never been true.”CNN has reached out to Penelope Hegseth for comment. An attorney for Pete Hegseth declined to comment.Read more about the Hegseth email here.', 'President-elect Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin TrudeauGetty ImagesPresident-electDonald Trumphad dinner with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday evening at Mar-a-Lago.The meeting came just days afterTrump promised massive hikes in tariffson goods from Mexico and Canada starting on the first day of his administration, specifically calling for a 25% tariff on all products sent to the US.Trump later said it was a “very productive” meeting, writing in a Truth Social post Saturday that the leaders had discussed a range of topics including fentanyl crossing the US border and the “massive trade deficit the U.S. has with Canada.”As Trudeau left a hotel in West Palm Beach on Saturday, he said his dinner with the president-elect “was an excellent conversation.”He did not stop to take further shouted questions about whether the two discussed tariffs or how he’s feeling about his relationship with the US president-elect.During an unrelated Friday morning news conference, Trudeau said he looks forward to having “lots of great conversations” with Trump and that the two will “work together to meet some of the concerns and respond to some of the issues.”“One of the things that is really important to understand is that Donald Trump, when he makes statements like that, he plans on carrying them out. There’s no question about it,” Trudeau said Friday. “Our responsibility is to point out that in this way he would be actually not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States; he’d actually be raising prices for American citizens as well and hurting American industry and businesses.”CNN’s Kit Maher contributed reporting to this post.']\"\n",
